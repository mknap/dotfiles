# My dotfile github experiment

I am leeching this from https://mjones44.medium.com/storing-dotfiles-in-a-git-repository-53f765c0005d

I did have to make a few edits to the config-init script to work with directory structures like `.config/hypr/config/file.conf`.

To get this started on new OS install, use 
```bash 
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mknap/dotfiles/refs/heads/master/config-init | bash
```
## Packages to install (pacman)
